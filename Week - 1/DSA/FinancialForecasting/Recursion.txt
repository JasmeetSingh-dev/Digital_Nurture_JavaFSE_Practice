Recursion is a technique in which a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems.

It simplifies problems by making the code cleaner and more compact for the problems that have some patterns that are repeating. 
Complex problems are reduced to base cases and smaller instances of themselves.
