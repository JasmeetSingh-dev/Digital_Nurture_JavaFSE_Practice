#  Suitability based on platform
Binary search is efficient for large, sorted datasets due to its logarithmic time complexity.
It provides faster search results compared to linear search.
E-commerce platforms often have many products, which makes binary search more scalable.
If products are kept in a sorted order, binary search reduces load and increases performance.
On the other hand linear search is simpler but it becomes inefficient as the number of products grows.
